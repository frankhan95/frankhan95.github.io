					<p><span>An interactive map for the Maritime Awareness Project (MAP) at NBR. </span><br><br>The visualization shows various martime activities in regards to US-Asia relations. I did mostly backend - database management as well as cartography work and contextual research. Specifically, I worked on the following layers: <br><br>-Air Defense System<br>-9-Dash Line<br>-Submarine Cables<br>-Tropical Storms<br><br>Link: <a href="http://maritimeawarenessproject.org/interactive-map/">NBR MAP</a> </p>

					<p><span>ArcPy tool to help import CSV files </span><br><br>ArcMap has no native support for CSV files, which is problematic when mass CSV files  need to be converted to geographic layers. <br>I wrote this ArcPy script tool that merges a  folder of CSV files and converts it into a  single dbf table. The tool has parameters to create point layers or line layers, streamlining the process. <br><br>The code is available here.</p>

Of course, it was never finalized but I learned a lot about game design, networking, and most importantly, scope. In short, two novice game devs should not be aiming for a triple-A level, space-shooter MMO. This important lesson has helped finish more projects and games since!</p>
